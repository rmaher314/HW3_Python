Py_Poll

Contents of Project:
    Resource:  election_data.csv
    Election_Results:  Election_Results.txt
    Py_Poll.py - code utilized to output the election results.

To preform this analysis, I took the following steps.

Accessed the CSV file and imported it into Python. and inported to read as a delimiter, and identified the headers.

Started my prework on the export portion that is performed at the end of the program to output finial report to txt.

Set my declarations for the program.

Started my "for loop" to preform the following tasks that were part of this project analysis.  
    -looked a thte total votes and divided them up based on last name to output a value of votes per canditate.  
    -I also assigned a specific counter to each canditate with I used along with the total votes to out put the percentage of votes that each canditate received. 

To figure out the percentage, as mentioned, used the total votes field and divided that into each individual canditates vote counter and multiplied that by 100 and set the decimals to 3 spaces.  

To figure out the winner I set one of the canditates as the Most Votes and used each subsequent canditate in an if statement to see if their total votes were higher than the initial declared canditate.  

Set up my analysis report with "f" statements so when I out put the text document it would contain the correct fields reqired for this report.
