    Py_Bank.py - code utilized for analysis

To perform this financial analysis, I took the following steps.

Accessed the CSV file and imported it into Python. and inported to read as a delimiter, and identified the headers.

Started my prework on the export portion that is performed at the end of the program to output finial report to txt.

Set my declarations for the program.

Started my "for loop" to preform the following tasks that were part of this project analysis.  
    -month counter
    -profit total
    -greatest increase/decrease in profits using if statement and idefity the month that both occurances took place.
    -average change was found by taking the total difference and diving it by the month counter then a round formula to only put out two decimals.  

Set up my analysis report with "f" statements so when I out put the text document it would contain the correct fields reqired for this report.
